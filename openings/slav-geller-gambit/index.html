<meta name="description" content="The Geller Gambit is an aggressive and tactical variation of the Slav Defense, named after the Soviet grandmaster Efim Geller. It arises after the following moves: d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 At this point, Black sacrifices a pawn with the idea of gaining active piece play and attacking chances. The main idea behind the Geller Gambit is to create imbalances and generate counterplay against White’s position. Key Ideas and Plans: For Black: After 7…b5, Black aims to develop quickly and create threats against White’s position. The idea is to use the pawn sacrifice to gain active piece play and pressure on the center and kingside. For White: White can accept the gambit and try to consolidate the extra pawn, but must be cautious of Black’s active pieces and potential counterplay. Moves like e4 can be considered to strengthen the center, but White must also be aware of Black’s tactical possibilities. Typical Continuation: After 7…b5, a common continuation is: Bd3 (or 8. Bb3) a6 9. O-O Bb7 From here, the game can lead to rich tactical battles, with both sides having chances. The Geller Gambit is less common than other lines in the Slav Defense, but it can catch opponents off guard and lead to exciting play. Overall, the Geller Gambit is a sharp and dynamic choice for Black, appealing to players who enjoy tactical skirmishes and are willing to take risks for active piece play." />

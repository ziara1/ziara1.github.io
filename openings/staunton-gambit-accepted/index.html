The goal is to develop pieces quickly and create threats against Black's position, particularly targeting the f7 square and looking for tactical opportunities.
- **For Black**: Black can accept the gambit and try to hold onto the extra pawn, but must be cautious of White's rapid development and potential threats. Alternatively, Black can decline the gambit with moves like 4...Nf6 or 4...Be7, aiming for a solid setup.

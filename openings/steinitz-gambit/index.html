It arises after the following moves: e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nd7 At this point, White can play: dxe5 This is where the gambit comes into play. Black can accept the gambit with: 4…dxe5 Now, White can continue with: Bc4 In this position, White aims to develop pieces rapidly and create threats against Black’s position, particularly targeting the f7 square. Key Ideas and Plans: For White: After 5. Bc4, White is looking to develop quickly and create tactical opportunities. The idea is to put pressure on the f7 pawn and potentially launch an attack against Black’s king. White can also consider moves like Ng5 to increase pressure on f7. For Black: Black has accepted the gambit and must be cautious about White’s attacking chances. Black can develop pieces and aim for solid pawn structure, but must be careful not to fall behind in development or allow White to generate too much initiative. Typical Continuation: After 5…Ngf6, a common continuation is: Ng5 This move puts immediate pressure on the f7 pawn, and Black must respond carefully to avoid falling into a dangerous position. Strategic Themes: Open Lines: The gambit leads to open lines and active piece play, allowing for tactical opportunities. - King Safety: Both players need to be mindful of king safety, especially in open positions that arise from the gambit. - Counterplay: Black must be careful to defend against White’s initiatives while looking for opportunities to consolidate and counterattack. The Steinitz Gambit is an interesting and aggressive choice for players who enjoy tactical skirmishes and are willing to take risks for active piece play. It can catch opponents off guard, especially if they are not familiar with the intricacies of the gambit." />

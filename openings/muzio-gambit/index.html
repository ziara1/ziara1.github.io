It is characterized by the following moves: e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 At this point, White is threatening the f7 pawn, which is a common theme in the Two Knights Defense. The main line continues with: 4… d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Nxf7 Here, White sacrifices the knight on f7 to create immediate threats against Black’s king. After 6… Kxf7, White continues with: Qf3+ This move puts pressure on the knight on d5 and also threatens to checkmate on f7. The Muzio Gambit leads to sharp and tactical positions where both sides must be careful.
